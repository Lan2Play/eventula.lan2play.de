==================================================

    .. warning::

        This fork of eventula manager is not 100% update compatible to the current upstream. We have intended to merge it someday, but currently there are to many changes and there is not enough time to do so. If you migrate from the upstream to our fork, please backup youre database and storage before doing so and please report any issues you encounter with the upgrade. Also this documentation is not fully up to date and not finished, so if you find something that is not right, consider contributing to it or open an issue. 


The Eventula Event Manager / ECO System is a fully featured White labeled Event Management system. The only prerequisite is docker and/or docker-compose. Everything is self contained. The purpose of this application is to unify Event Management (Venue, attendees, seating), Ticket Sales, Tournament Management, Shop Management and Credit Management.
